# Periodic Table Quiz

A program which quizzes the user on some attributes of elements on the periodic table.

## How to Run

Download the file and / or run the code on your IDE of choice (Codeblocks or DevC++ should both work). There are two versions of this quiz which have slightly varying functionality. "pTableOmnicodeV1.c" asks for the names derived from atomic numbers and "atomicMasses1.c" asks for the atomic masses (as outlined by a very particular table and not to any consistent number of decimal places) derived from names.

## How to Use

In both cases, the user must input a string of characters which matches the correct answer. Refer to the code for the correct answers if need be.

### pTableOmnicodeV1.c

Pressing "T" on the title screen will toggle on/off a smart selection feature where the likelihood of elements appearing is incrementally increased if the user gets them wrong and decreased if the user gets them right. This is meant to act as a memorization tool that puts focus on difficult elements.

### atomicMasses1.c

This quiz has two modes which either list all the elements in order or select randomly. There is no smart-select feature here.
